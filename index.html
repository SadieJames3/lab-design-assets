          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>
            My name is Sadie. I am an aspiring web developer located in New York City. A little more about
            me...technology is always changing and as a devoted fan, I've made it my career to learn as much as I can and use it in as may ways as my imagination can come up with. This page is just a few of my accomplishments for you to view and enjoy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am passionate about technology, reading, eating and relaxing. Oh, and motorcycles!
          </p>
          <p>
            A cool fact about me is...I learned to operate manual transmission at 14 years old and got my CDL about 6 years ago. I can drive trucks!

      <h4>Work Experience</h4>
      <p>
        I've worked in many fields since high school, ranging from retail to security to office work. I even spent a short time in the military. That didn't go as planned...so I broke into tech by apprenticing with an acquaintance to install retail point of sale (POS) terminals and kitchen display terminals. We upgraded to server builds and takedowns, then moved into running cables for new establishments. I felt this was too hard on my body so I took a bootcamp and transitioned into my first corporate job with a large magazine pushisher as one of their in house deskside help techs. At this time, manufacturers were beginning to solder the parts into computers, making my job obsolete. I took a break to drive trucks for a while and am now ready to venture back into tech. I am presently learning front end web development and hope to make this a long term fulfilling venture.
